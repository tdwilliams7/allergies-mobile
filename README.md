## Mobile component to the Allergy Tracker app.

[WebVersion](https://github.com/tdwilliams7/allergyfinder)

###Client

* React-Native, Native-Base, maybe react-router-navigation(still deciding to the router), Probably redux, figure out jwts for auth.

###Backend

* Server will look a lot like the server for Web Version.

#### This is really early but I am excited to build this. New tech and trying to help my nephew from sicking sick
